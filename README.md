Aim : Following are the aim of Today's Experiment :
1) To study multiple methods of Variable Declaration
2) To Detect the Datatype of a Variable using "Type" Keyword    
3) To Perform Arithmatic Operations on Variables - Calculator
4) To declare a User-Defined Variable  
5) To calculate the Area of a Circle
6) To calculate Log Values
7) To calculate the Trignometric Value
8) To compare two Numbers using the if Command

Theory : The Following Points were covered during the Lecture : 
1) Multiple Variable declaration using "," in the print command
2) The use of Type Keyword - To determine the datatype of a variable using "Type" Keyword 
3) To perform Arithmatic Operations on Variables : +(addition) , -(subtraction) , *(Multiplicaation) , /(Division) , **(Exponents)
4) To declare the user - defined variables using the "input" command
5) To calculate the area of circle by implementing : import math function and subsequently by using math.pi (area = math.pi * r**2)
6) To calculate Log Values by implementing : import math function and by using log10(10) [log 10 to base 10]
7) To calculate the Trignometric Value by implementing : import math function and by using math.sin(math.pi/3) - sin(60)
8) To compare Two numbers : if function (if a>b (Condition for boolean value True) : , else:(Condition for boolean value False))

Algorithm : 
1) Calculator
   - Input the two Numbers
   - Read the two Numbers
   - Perform The arithmatic operations on the two Numbers ( a+b - Addition , a-b - Subtraction, a*b - Multiplicaation , a/b - Division and a**b - Exponents)
   - Display the Result
2) Area of circle
   - Input The Radius of the Circle
   - Read the Value
   - perform the Calculations for calculating the area of Circle (math.pi*R**2)
   - Display the Result
3) Compare the Two Numbers
   - Input the two Numbers from the user
   - Read the numbers
   - Compare the Number using the "if" command ( if a>b : (Condition for boolean value True) , else :(Condition for boolean value False))
   - Display the result

   Conclusion : The Basics Introduction to Python was successfully demonstrated .
